sevenbridges-python documentation!
==================================

sevenbridges-python is a `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ library that provides an interface for the `Seven Bridges Platform <http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/the-api>`_ and `Cancer Genomics Cloud <http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/the-cgc-api>`_ public APIs.

The Seven Bridges Platform is a cloud-based environment for conducting bioinformatic analyses. It is a central hub for teams to store, analyze, and jointly interpret their bioinformatic data. The Platform co-locates analysis pipelines alongside the largest genomic datasets to optimize processing, allocating storage and compute resources on demand.

The The Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC), powered by Seven Bridges, is also a cloud-based computation environment. It was built as one of three pilot systems funded by the National Cancer Institute to explore the paradigm of colocalizing massive genomics datasets, like The Cancer Genomics Atlas (TCGA), alongside secure and scalable computational resources to analyze them. The CGC makes more than a petabyte of multi-dimensional data available immediately to authorized researchers. You can add your own data to analyze alongside TCGA using predefined analytical workflows or your own tools.
